Artificial Immune Systems (AIS) are a class of optimization algorithms inspired by the behavior of the immune system in the human body.


Artificial Immune Systems (AIS) are a class of optimization algorithms inspired by the behavior of the 
immune system in the human body.
In AIS, the immune system is modeled as a collection of components such as antigens, 
antibodies, and lymphocytes that interact with each other to recognize and respond to foreign objects (i.e., pathogens).
The goal of AIS is to use these principles to solve optimization 
problems by representing solutions as antigens and using antibodies and lymphocytes to search the solution space.

The AIS algorithm has several parameters that need to be defined by the user, 
including the number of antigens, the number of antibodies, 
the mutation rate, and the selection mechanism.
